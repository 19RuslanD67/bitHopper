# Instructions

In order to run bithopper you need twisted phython and pyopenssl installed with Python 2.7 (recommended):

http://python.org/download/
https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+download
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface (for Windows)
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac

Copy "user.cfg.default" to a new file called "user.cfg" then modify the new
file to include your pool worker usernames and passwords, instead of mine.
Run "python bitHopper.py". After script updates info, please check if new pools
have been added correctly if not edit your "user.cfg" accordingly.

If you don't want to use a pool give it an invalid password (WARNING: some pools
ignore passwords from miners!), or go to http://localhost:8337/stats and switch its
role to disable, or just delete it from "user.cfg".

BitHopper listens on loopback interface so you should direct your miner to
localhost:8337 with any username and password (not blank).

BitHopper status page: http://localhost:8337/stats
