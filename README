# Ubuntu installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run:

sudo apt-get install python2.7 git python2.7-dev python-setuptools python-pip libevent-dev
git clone git://github.com/c00w/bitHopper.git
cd bitHopper
sudo python setup.py install
python run.py

Tested and working in Ubuntu 12.04.

# Other Linux Installations
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Use pip to install your libraries. We need fairly recent versions of everything.
The libraries bundled with debian are too old.

# Instructions for Windows users
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: IF YOU ARE RUNNING LOTS OF MINERS USE LINUX.
It's a lot more stable and takes less modifications.

Download and install
1. Python
http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi
Make sure you are using the 32 bit version.

2. Greenlet
http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/g/greenlet/greenlet-0.3.4.win32-py2.7.exe

3. Gevent
http://gevent.googlecode.com/files/gevent-1.0b2.win32-py2.7.msi
It is recommended that you install the latest version because some users reported that earlier versions to 1.x cause problems with the latest versions of BitHopper (see https://github.com/c00w/bitHopper/issues/671#issuecomment-7496513 )

4. SetupTools
http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe#md5=57e1e64f6b7c7f1d2eddfc9746bbaf20

7. BitHopper
github.com/c00w/bitHopper
Go to downloads and hit zip. Extract the zip to your desktop

8. Bundled Dependencies
Enter the bitHopper folder
Double click install.py, it may appear to just be "install" with no ".py" extension

Running bitHopper
Open a console, navigate to the directory where you unzipped the BitHopper (with cd) and type the following: python setup.py install

#Where to point you miners
Have your miner use http://localhost:8337/

# Configuring user settings
Worker Configuration page: http://localhost:8339/worker
BitHopper Stats page: http://localhost:8339/stats

# Large Scale Users
-------------------------
If you are mining with more than ~5GH/s you should make sure to do the following.
1) 
Make sure you have libevent installed if you are on linux
2) 
Put in a couple of workers for each pool you are mining at.
Lots of pools have a global rate limiter for how fast they will accept
work from a single worker
3) If you are running out of connection sockets on the client side send me
an email and I'll walk your through setting up bitHopper to run with uwsgi
